radio_check.sh

A bash script that checks urls saved in [radiotray-ng](https://github.com/ebruck/radiotray-ng) bookmarks using ffprobe (part of [FFmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg)). It can simultaneously play them for a specified # of seconds with mpv (media player).

Included is my current bookmarks.json file for use in radiotray-ng.
